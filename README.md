## Description

This is a refactor of my html and css mobile responsive website to a single webpage multi-component react website. The technologies I used were react and in order to deploy it I had to use the transpiler babel. The transpiler converts the es six and seven javascript elements into es 5 which the browser can use and display. What was cool about this project was I could pretty much copy and past my html directly into the java script file and with some minor tweaking could turn it into react jsx. This project was pretty simple and fun.
